# Minecraft-3-speedrunners-Manhunt-plugin
Similar to the remake of the Minecraft Manhunt by Dream that I made, except it works for THREE speedrunners


To enable three speedrunner manhunt, you have to use the command /target3 like this:

/target3 playername1 playername2 playername3

(The command will only take three arguments, otherwise it will not work.)

After this command has been run, all players except the 3 speedrunners will receive a compass (if they don't have one). Now, whenever a hunter right clicks their compass, their compass will point to the first speedrunner/target, and when they right click the next time, their compass will point to the next speedrunner/target. The compass will cycle through the players whenever you right click the compass.

If you want to stop the 3 speedrunner manhunt, then use the command /stoptarget3. (Note: /stoptarget3 does NORT take ANY arguments.)
